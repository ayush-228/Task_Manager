#How long did you spend on the coding test? 
    I have spend more than 5 hrs on this coding test.


#What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?
    One of the most useful features added to recent versions of JavaScript is optional chaining (?.), introduced in ES2020. This feature simplifies accessing deeply nested properties, making the code cleaner and reducing the need for multiple checks to prevent errors if any property in the chain is undefined or null.

  const [title, setTitle] = useState(task?.title || '');
  const [description, setDescription] = useState(task?.description || '');
  const [dueDate, setDueDate] = useState(task?.dueDate || '');
  const [priority, setPriority] = useState(task?.priority || 'Medium');

  useEffect(() => {
    setTitle(task?.title || '');
    setDescription(task?.description || '');
    setDueDate(task?.dueDate || '');
    setPriority(task?.priority || 'Medium');
  }, [task]);


  #How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
      No

 #If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
    With more time, some valuable additions to your task management application could include:

   1. Sort and Filter Enhancements: Enhance filtering options, allowing users to sort tasks 
      by creation date, due date, and priority, with customizable filters for a tailored 
      task view.
   2. Archive Completed Tasks: Implement a feature to archive completed tasks rather than 
      deleting them. This keeps the task list manageable but allows users to refer back to 
      completed tasks when needed.
   3. Reminders and Notifications: Integrate notifications via email or push notifications 
      to remind users of approaching due dates or overdue tasks, enhancing task visibility 
      and completion rates.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
